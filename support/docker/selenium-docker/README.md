### Headless testing with Docker selenium Grid
This directory contains a selenium grid and basic node setup
if choosing to run headless browser tests locally using docker containers to run your selenium hub and nodes.
The hostip script is needed (or something similar) as the selenium nodes will need to know how to communicate back to the application server (if running on host vm)
